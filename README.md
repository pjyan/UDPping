# Getting Started

### Step 1

Set up a udp echo server at the host you want to ping. 

There are many ways of doing this, my favourite way is:

```
socat -v UDP-LISTEN:4000,fork PIPE
```

Now a echo server is listening at port 4000. 

###### Note
If you dont have socat, use `apt install socat` or `yum install socat`, you will get it.

### Step 2

Ping you server.

Assume `44.55.66.77` is the IP of your server.

```
./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000
```

Done!

Now UDPping will generate outputs as a normal ping, but the protocol used is `UDP` instead of `ICMP`.

# Advanced Usage
```
$ ./udpping.py -h
usage: udpping.py [-h] [-l LEN] [-i INTERVAL] [-c COUNT] dest_ip dest_port

ping with UDP protocol

positional arguments:
  dest_ip               destination IP address(IPv4/IPv6)
  dest_port             destination port

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LEN, --len LEN     payload length, unit:byte, default is 64
  -i INTERVAL, --interval INTERVAL
                        interval between each packet, unit: ms, default is 1000
  -c COUNT, --count COUNT
                        number of packets, default is unlimited

examples:
  ./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000  -l 400 -i 2000
  ./udpping.py fe80::5400:ff:aabb:ccdd 4000
  ./udpping.py 44.55.66.77 4000 -l 400 -i 2000 -c 100')

   
```
